<b> <h3> customer review</h3></b>
        <p><b>this game is just such an experience, from the tactical gameplay and unique operators based on real life events and actual tactical units like 707th smb or the GIGN. they put time into minute details which is just astonishing. The first person teamwork based shooter, completely relying on skill, and teamwork, and audio cues too. its a breath of fresh air from the over saturated shooter market, where everyone is copying to big thing, siege does it different. its a beautiful experience to go through. There is a learning curve tho and has a amazing community and is available on all the major gaming platforms (PS4, XBOX,P.C.). For anyone as well using reviews to make a decision on buying this game, then id say its worth it. the ingame store is also amazing, unlike fortnite, call of duty or any other shooting game, you can almost buy every thing in the store with renown, which you get around 100-200 per game. But, for a shorter route you can buy the skins headgear or weapon skins for a couple of what is called r6 credits which are cheap, (to give you an idea with twenty bucks you can get 4 operators, which  is the equivalent of one fortnite skin.</p>
